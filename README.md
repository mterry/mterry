### Objective

I am a solutions architect, entrepreneur, and software developer looking for a position where my passion for technology, people, and transformation will be viewed as an asset. I specifically seek architect- or solution-level positions where I leverage my talents and skills in consulting with customers, collaborating with engineers and stakeholders to develop new solutions, move markets, and delight customers.

### Who Am I?

I am an avid technologist, programmer, and writer. I desire to explore, understand, and navigate complex environments and problems existing in complex environments, and ultimately create solutions to those same problems or environmental factors. I strive to not stop gaps, but solve fundamental problems. I have a wide base of knowledge, skills, and experience to lean on to innovate, design, and develop solutions and strategies, and communicate those same solutions with the key stakeholders regardless of their background.

I am passioned, but headstrong. I am dedicated, tenacious, goal-oriented. I strive to not just succeed, instead I aim to excel. I am driven to delight customers.
